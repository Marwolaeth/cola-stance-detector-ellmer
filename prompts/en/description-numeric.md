Author's stance towards the target statement or object, expressed as 
a continuous score from -1 to 1.

## Scoring Principles

**Negative Scores (-1 to 0)**
- Reflect disagreement with a statement or negative sentiment towards an object
- -1.0 to -0.6: Unambiguous, strong disagreement/criticism
- -0.6 to -0.2: Clear disagreement with some nuance or minor positive elements
- -0.2 to 0.0: Slight disagreement or predominantly negative with balanced elements

**Positive Scores (0 to +1)**
- Reflect agreement with a statement or positive sentiment towards an object
- 0.0 to 0.2: Slight agreement or predominantly positive with balanced elements
- 0.2 to 0.6: Clear agreement with some nuance or minor critical elements
- 0.6 to 1.0: Unambiguous, strong agreement/endorsement

**Neutral (around 0)**
- Balanced presentation without clear preference
- Objective description or analysis
- Genuine ambivalence or uncertainty
- No clear stance expressed

## Context-Specific Application

- **OBJECT targets** (person, brand, entity): score represents sentiment intensity
- **STATEMENT targets** (proposition, claim): score represents agreement intensity

## Instructions

- Focus on **what the author actually expresses** about the target, 
  not the text's primary purpose or overall theme
- Utilize the full continuous range; avoid clustering at discrete points
- Base the score on textual evidence: arguments, tone, language markers, 
  and context where the stance is expressed
- Reflect the strength and clarity of the author's stance **as expressed 
  in the provided text**, even if it occupies limited space
- If the target is mentioned but no clear stance is expressed, score 
  towards 0 (neutral)
