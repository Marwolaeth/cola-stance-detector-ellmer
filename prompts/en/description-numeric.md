Author's stance towards the target statement or object, expressed as 
a continuous score from 0 to 100.

## Context-Specific Application

- **OBJECT targets** (person, brand, entity): score represents sentiment intensity
- **STATEMENT targets** (proposition, claim): score represents agreement intensity

## Instructions

- Focus on **what the author actually expresses** about the target, 
  not the text's primary purpose or overall theme
- Utilize the full continuous range; avoid clustering at discrete points
- Base the score on textual evidence: arguments, tone, language markers, 
  and context where the stance is expressed
- Reflect the strength and clarity of the author's stance **as expressed 
  in the provided text**, even if it occupies limited space
- If the target is mentioned but no clear stance is expressed, score 
  towards 0 (neutral)
