Author's stance towards the target statement or object, on a 5-point scale.

**Scale:**
- Strongly Disagree
- Disagree
- Neutral
- Agree
- Strongly Agree

**Interpretation:**
- If target is an OBJECT (person, brand, entity): score reflects sentiment 
  intensity (Strongly Disagree = strong disapproval, Strongly Agree = strong approval).
- If target is a STATEMENT (proposition, claim): score reflects agreement 
  intensity (Strongly Disagree = strong disagreement, Strongly Agree = strong agreement).

**Important:** Evaluate based on what IS expressed in the text, even if 
the target is mentioned peripherally or in limited sections.

**Example:**
- Text: "The government is corrupt and incompetent" + Target: "government" 
  → Stance: Strongly Disagree (strong disapproval)
- Text: "The new policy has both pros and cons" + Target: "new policy" 
  → Stance: Neutral (no clear position)
