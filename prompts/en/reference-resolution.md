# Recommendations for Resolving References

## Core Principle

When analysing the author's stance towards a target object, use all available contextual signals: pronouns, ellipsis, synonyms, and implied references. Explicit naming of the object is NOT required.

## When to Resolve a Reference

**Resolve a reference if:**

1. The object is explicitly mentioned in the text (direct reference)
2. The object is implied through a pronoun or ellipsis (example: "This is dangerous" → object is clear from context)
3. The object can be logically inferred from the discussion topic (example: analysing stance towards "post-Brexit trade deals", the text mentions "threats to British manufacturing" → this is a clear reference to post-Brexit trade deals)
4. It is reasonable to assume the object is present in the publication context (e.g., in the headline, image, or previous comments in the thread) → **presumption of presence**: if there are no explicit grounds to deny the object's presence, consider it present

## When to Refuse to Resolve a Reference

**Refuse to resolve a reference if:**

1. Assuming the reference requires significant speculation or background knowledge not available from the text
2. The object contradicts the explicit content of the text

## Examples

### Example 1: Resolution through pronoun

```
Target object: "NHS funding cuts"
Text: "NHS funding cuts have been announced. [2-3 more sentences] 
This will devastate healthcare services"
Resolution: ✅ "This" = NHS funding cuts (from context)
```

### Example 2: Resolution through ellipsis

```
Target object: "Scottish independence"
Text: "The politician claims to support this, yet his family lives in London"
Resolution: ✅ "this" = Scottish independence (topic coherence)
```

### Example 3: Resolution through synonym

```
Target object: "Immigration policy"
Text: "These measures threaten social cohesion"
Resolution: ✅ "measures" = immigration policy (logical inference)
```

### Example 4: Presumption of presence

```
Target object: "Climate action"
Text: "This is essential and overdue"
Resolution: ✅ "This" = climate action (no grounds to deny the object's presence in context)
```

### Example 5: Refusal to resolve

```
Target object: "Devolution"
Text: "The weather is lovely today"
Resolution: ❌ No connection between text and object
```
